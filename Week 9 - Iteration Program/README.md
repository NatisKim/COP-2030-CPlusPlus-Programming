# Iteration Program

I modified the two programs, tic-tac-toe and calculator, by adding the iteration function.

For the tic-tac-toe program, I also improved the board by keeping the numbers in the spots visible each time the player makes a turn. Iteration was implemented to allow each player to complete a round of the tic-tac-toe game until all spaces are filled or the game is won. The options include "the game is a draw", "Player 1 wins", and "Player 2 wins". It also provides error checking to prevent an invalid option to be chosen. It also asks the player to enter yes or no when prompted to play another game at the end.

For the calculator program, I modified the switch function to improve it and make the code more easy to read. Iteration is also used to create a loop that permits multiple operations to be performed sequentially. It also asks the user if they want to continue performing mathematical operations. An exponent function was also added in the subroutine and switch statement, and was calculated using only addition and multiplication with loops. Error checking was also added while on a loop, that makes sure the user does not enter an incorrect value for the continuation question and operations.

* Output after running the code, that shows Player 1 and Player 2 playing a complete game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This also shows error checking throughout.
