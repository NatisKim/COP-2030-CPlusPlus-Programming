# Programming Project Week 2

For this week, I completed two programming projects in C++. The first project was creating a blank tic-tac-toe board. The second project was creating a simple calculator and performing mathematical operations. For this simple calculator, I inputted the values 17 and 5 for the mathematical operation.
